🎓 Data Science MSc graduate from the University of Leeds with a strong background in Computer Science (BE from VIT).

🔍 Skilled in Python, R, SQL, and various data science frameworks and tools. Proven track record in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP.

💼 Experience includes impactful roles at Wipro Technologies where I spearheaded data-driven strategies, optimizing discount schemes and promotional campaigns, resulting in significant sales growth and revenue increase.

🚀 Led innovative projects like:
- **Stock Market Forecasting** using SARIMA and LSTM

These projects demonstrate my prowess in AI and ML applications.

✍️ Side note: I’ve been making hand-written notes on every step of the data science lifecycle. They’re still a work in progress, kind of like a "beta version" of a data nerd's journal. Not groundbreaking yet, but I keep adding content—like a personal Wikipedia that doesn’t let you down at 2 a.m.!
